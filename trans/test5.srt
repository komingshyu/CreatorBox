1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
 I have 15 really easy videos I film.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,300
 So if I die, my channel can keep uploading.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,380
 Let's unpack that.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,280
 What do you mean?

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,100
 Certain people in my company know on my old computer

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,460
 where to find these videos.

7
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,820
 And then I was just like, yeah,

8
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,900
 just upload these once a month.

9
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,340
 So it's like, I'm still alive.

10
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,360
 Wait, so it's the final video of you being like,

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,820
 oh, so I'm dead now.

12
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,420
 I like in that video made jokes like,

13
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,560
 don't feel bad for me, I'm dead.

14
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,960
 But there's another video after that.

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,460
 They'll title it like my last video.

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,260
 And then a month later, there's another one.

17
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:25,900
 Psych.

18
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,840
 Yo, that's crazy.
